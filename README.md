# Countdown
Overkilled experiment with modern web frontend technologies to produce a fancy countdown timer.

How to build
------------
Install node/io.js, then run
```bash
npm install -g gulp && npm install
gulp
```

This will build the project into `dist` directory. Use any static http server to serve it and open ``countdown.html``.
*It will not work if is opened locally (without the server).*
